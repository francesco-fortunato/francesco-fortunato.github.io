Iâ€™m Francesco Fortunato, a master's student in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome. I began my academic journey with a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Automation Engineering from the same university.

My areas of expertise and interest include the Internet of Things (IoT), telecommunications, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

At present, I am dedicated to further enhancing my skill set, engaging in diverse projects, and staying abreast of emerging technologies. Through both study and practical projects, I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and capabilities.

I am Francesco Fortunato, a recent graduate holding a Master's degree in Engineering in Computer Science from [Sapienza Universit√† di Roma](http://www.uniroma1.it/). I commenced my academic journey with a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Automation Engineering from the same esteemed institution.

My areas of expertise and interest include the Internet of Things (IoT), telecommunications, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I am passionate about devising innovative solutions and addressing complex challenges through the application of advanced coding techniques.

At present, I am dedicated to further enhancing my skill set, engaging in diverse projects, and staying abreast of emerging technologies. Through both academic research and practical projects, I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and capabilities.
